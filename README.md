Hi! My name is Oliver B. I'm a web + game developer and 3D + graphic designer. I use the platform Roblox for most of my game development, however I will be trying out Unity in the future. For design, I use Illustrator and Blender.

## I currently write in the following languages:
- C++ (Arduino, first text language)
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS (web development)
- Luau (Roblox development)
- Lua (native lua projects)
- Python
